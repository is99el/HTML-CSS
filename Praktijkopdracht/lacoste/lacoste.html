          <h2>About Lacoste</h2>
          <p>René Lacoste, a legendary tennis champion in the 1920s, embodied elegance in everything he did. As a visionary free thinker, he defied given rules to innovate, invent and reinvent throughout his life. One example is the creation of the very first short-sleeved polo shirt in breathable fabric that he designed to increase freedom of movement during play. This piece led to the founding of a brand capable of liberating fashion codes with elegance as its founding value.

            The values that inspired René in his life are those that focus on others, fair play and generosity. This is the story of a daring player whose tenacity saw him nicknamed “the crocodile.” This symbol then became his logo – the very first to be displayed on clothing – and went on to gain worldwide recognition. This is the story of friendship and teamwork: a spirit of cooperation that continues today in the brand’s collaborations with leading artists and designers. Last but not least, this is the story of the women in his life: his wife Simone Thion de la Chaume and Suzanne Lenglen, his friend, winning women who were just as determined, free thinking and elegant as him.</p>
